# ERC-721 Implementation

A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.

NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets, eg:

* Physical property — houses, unique artwork
* Virtual collectables — unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards
* “Negative value” assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities

NFTs are distinguishable and you must track the ownership of each one separately.
